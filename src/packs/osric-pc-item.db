The chest itself must be crafted of the finest materials in order to support the spell's magic, and it will cost a minimum of 5,000 gp to have a craftsman or craftsmen build it, together with a second, miniature copy. When the magic user casts the spell, one hand upon the chest and one upon the miniature, the chest disappears into the æthereal plane, together with its contents. These contents may be up to one cubic foot of material per caster level (and no more than this) regardless of the chest's actual volume. If the chest contains any living matter, there is a 75% chance that the spell will completely fail, although if it should succeed, the living creature will be imprisoned in the æthereal plane until freed. The caster (and only the caster) can use the miniature chest to pull the larger one from the æther wherever he or she might be. It is possible, although not likely, that some æthereal creature or æthereal traveller might happen upon the chest while it is in the æthereal plane. So long as the chest remains in the æthereal plane, the magic user will still be able to retrieve it (although it may have been looted). No creature on the material plane has any chance using any magic known to humanity to locate a secret chest that has been hidden in the æthereal plane by means of this spell. After the spell duration expires, there is a cumulative 1 in 20 chance per day that the spell's link to the chest will fail, and the chest will be irrecoverable.</p>\n\t\t\t","dmonlytext":"","itemList":[],"attributes":{"rarity":"","type":"","subtype":"","magic":false,"properties":[],"identified":true},"charges":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0},"location":{"state":"carried","parent":""},"resource":{"itemId":""},"actions":[{"img":"icons/weapons/staves/staff-ornate-red.webp","ability":"none","type":"cast","targeting":"","successAction":"none","formula":"","otherdmg":[],"effectList":[],"effect":{"duration":{"formula":"","type":"round"},"changes":[]},"speed":99,"damagetype":"slashing","resource":{"type":"none","itemId":"","reusetime":"","count":{"cost":1,"min":0,"max":1,"value":0}},"magicpotency":0,"properties":[],"dmonlytext":"","itemList":[],"saveCheck":{"type":"none","formula":""},"abilityCheck":{"type":"none","formula":""},"id":"wze2r0829upvshvw","index":0,"name":"Secret Chest"},{"img":"icons/magic/time/hourglass-yellow-green.webp","ability":"none","type":"effect","targeting":"","successAction":"none","formula":"","otherdmg":[],"effectList":[],"effect":{"duration":{"formula":"+60","type":"day"},"changes":[{"key":"Secret Chest","value":"SPELL","mode":0}]},"speed":99,"damagetype":"slashing","resource":{"type":"none","itemId":"","reusetime":"","count":{"cost":1,"min":0,"max":1,"value":0}},"magicpotency":0,"properties":[],"dmonlytext":"","itemList":[],"saveCheck":{"type":"none","formula":""},"abilityCheck":{"type":"none","formula":""},"id":"aqg1qdcj8twujxtt","index":1,"name":"Secret Chest"}],"quantity":0,"weight":0,"cost":{"value":0,"currency":"gp"},"source":"OSRIC","xp":0,"audio":{"effect":"","success":"","failure":""},"type":"Arcane","level":"5","school":"Transmutation, Alteration","sphere":"MU","range":"See below","components":{"verbal":true,"somatic":true,"material":true},"materials":{"value":null,"consumed":false,"cost":0,"count":0},"durationText":"60 days","castingTime":"1 turn","areaOfEffect":"One chest or box, 12 cubic ft","save":"None"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PXJxlGCNBzbPFTjR":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"a6a7f3641d6c752525781f563b57fb09597ca2f5","sourceId":"Item.0aKgp2UpnKsFi0jT"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.osric-pc-item.0aKgp2UpnKsFi0jT"},"cf":{"id":"temp_0dyvs3tb97ir","path":"osric-pc-item#/CF_SEP/spell","color":"#000000"}}}

Damage modifiers (such as those pertaining to strength or magic) are not multiplied from a backstab.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Climb: Climbing represents a thief's ability to scale sheer walls and surfaces, cling to ceilings, and perform other feats of climbing that would normally be impossible. Climbing checks must ordinarily be repeated for every ten ft of climbing. Non-thieves cannot climb walls, cliffs, or any vertical surface without the use of a rope or magic, making the presence of a thief vital to many adventuring parties.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Find Traps: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>This ability represents the thief's minute visual inspection of a new area for tiny telltale signs that something of interest or danger may be concealed nearby. It requires a full turn (10 minutes) to accomplish.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Hide in Shadows: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Some shadow must be present for this ability to be used, but if the check is successful the thief is effectively invisible until he makes an attack or moves from the shadows. The ability can also be used to blend in with a crowd of people rather than disappear into shadows.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Move Quietly: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Use of this skill allows the thief to move with preternatural silence even over surfaces such as squeaky floors.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Open Locks/ Disarm Traps: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Opening locks and disarming traps (without springing them) is a skill unique to thieves, which cannot be successfully attempted by members of other classes. A thief can also set traps (with the same chance as to disarm).</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Pick Pockets: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>If the thief's pick pockets check fails by 20% or more, then his or her attempt has been discovered and the intended victim will almost always take hostile action</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Read Languages: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>The thief may attempt to read languages and ciphers of a non-magical nature only.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Thieves' Cant: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Thieves have their own language.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p/>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>Advanced Abilities</b>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Read Scrolls (10th): </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>When a thief reaches 10th level, he or she has become well-versed enough in training to cast spells from an arcane or phantasmal scroll (magic user or illusionist). However, this casting is not always successful. The thief should roll against his or her intelligence as a magic user or illusionist does, and if the score shown on the die is insufficient for the thief to cast the spell, then the casting will fail, possibly (at the GM's option) having some entirely unexpected effect.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Thief skills progress as the thief levels and are modified by dexterity and race as per these

To accomplish the transfer of souls, the magic user must trap his or her own life essence within the jar prior to the transfer. If the transfer fails (e.g. <b>, if the targeted creature makes a successful saving throw), the caster's soul is trapped until it can take over a host or otherwise escape </b>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The caster can make successive attempts to take over the same host, but no more than one per round. The spell's range applies to two matters; when the magic user first transfers his or her own life essence into the jar, his or her body must be within the spell's range of the jar. The range also limits the distance at which the magic user's soul may later escape from the jar and into another body. After the caster's soul moves into the jar, his or her physical body becomes inert and lifeless.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The spell represents, in many ways, a contest of will between the magic user and the creature whose body he or she seeks to possess. The caster and the target creature each total their intelligence and wisdom scores (such being calculated or approximated by the GM for a monster).</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>This combined score represents the character's mental power for purposes of the spell. <b>The two numbers are compared, and the difference is used in two important calculations: the saving throw and the chance for escape </b>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>One third of the difference (rounded down) is the modifier on the saving throw, a bonus if the target creature has the higher mental power, a penalty if the magic user's mental power is higher </b>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>If a creature's soul is trapped in the magic jar by the caster, it has a chance to escape. If it escapes, the caster's soul is returned to the magic jar. <b>If the difference in mental power between the caster and the possessed creature is 4 or less in favour of the caster, or is in favour of the possessed creature, the creature can attempt a new saving throw every round </b>. <b>If the difference is from 5 to 8 in the caster's favour, one saving throw is permitted per turn </b>. <b>If the difference is 9 to 12 in the caster's favour, the saving throw is made once per day, and if the caster's mental power exceeds that of the target creature by 13+, the saving throw </b><b><u>can only be made once per week </u></b>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>While the caster is in the magic jar waiting to possess another body, he or she can sense creatures beyond the jar, but not their nature. The jar may be moved from its original location, but not, obviously, by the caster. When the caster possesses another body, he or she gains complete control of its movement and acquires any memories that the body might reflexively recall (how to fly, fight with claws, use innate magical powers, etc). He or she does not gain any knowledge from the creature's mind, such as languages known or the location of a lair, for the mind is trapped in the magic jar. The caster retains his or her own mind while possessing the other body, so if the body possesses the correct physical attributes the caster can continue to cast his or her spells from within the new body.</p>\n\t\t\t","dmonlytext":"","itemList":[],"attributes":{"rarity":"","type":"","subtype":"","magic":false,"properties":[],"identified":true},"charges":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0},"location":{"state":"carried","parent":""},"resource":{"itemId":""},"actions":[{"img":"icons/weapons/staves/staff-ornate-red.webp","ability":"none","type":"cast","targeting":"","successAction":"none","formula":"","otherdmg":[],"effectList":[],"effect":{"duration":{"formula":"","type":"round"},"changes":[]},"speed":99,"damagetype":"slashing","resource":{"type":"none","itemId":"","reusetime":"","count":{"cost":1,"min":0,"max":1,"value":0}},"magicpotency":0,"properties":[],"dmonlytext":"","itemList":[],"saveCheck":{"type":"spell","formula":""},"abilityCheck":{"type":"none","formula":""},"id":"477nsdk0axebtvk5","index":0,"name":"Magic Jar"}],"quantity":0,"weight":0,"cost":{"value":0,"currency":"gp"},"source":"OSRIC","xp":0,"audio":{"effect":"","success":"","failure":""},"type":"Arcane","level":"5","school":"Possession","sphere":"MU","range":"10 ft/ level","components":{"verbal":true,"somatic":true,"material":true},"materials":{"value":null,"consumed":false,"cost":0,"count":0},"durationText":"See below","castingTime":"1 round","areaOfEffect":"One creature","save":"Negates"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PXJxlGCNBzbPFTjR":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"47ff536e7c1e7880932159bf5717d0aa1b3d705b","sourceId":"Item.9ghxOUfeuiLWtHIC"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.osric-pc-item.9ghxOUfeuiLWtHIC"},"cf":{"id":"temp_0dyvs3tb97ir","path":"osric-pc-item#/CF_SEP/spell","color":"#000000"}}}

The wall might be 10 ft high and 200 ft long, or 5 ft high and 400 ft long, or 20 ft high and 100 ft long, etc. The wall need not be cast so that it is attached to anything, and it can even be cast in the air to fall upon opponents, doing [[/roll 3d10]] points of damage in the area where it falls.

Together with the ranger and paladin, they have the most hit points, and their ability to survive the most brutal battles is therefore unrivalled.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>They also have the best chance \"to hit\" of all the classes, particularly at higher level. They may use any kind of armour, shield, or weapon. Most fighters look forward to the day when their reputations will bring them into the ranks of the lesser nobility, where fighting prowess and armed followers are more important than high-flown bloodlines.

If weapon specialisation is not selected during character generation, it remains forever unavailable to the character, barring some magical or divine intervention. If weapon specialisation is in play, fighters may take a second proficiency in the same weapon as the first, granting them one extra attack every 2 rounds with the weapon (hence 3/2 attacks with a melee weapon at 1st level, 2/1 at 7th and 5/2 at 13th), +1 to hit and +2 damage owing to their skill.

Thus, for example, a 20th level fighter with 19 strength and a +5 sword attacking an AC 2 dragon would require a roll of -8 to hit it; the character would be allowed to modify his or her damage roll

{"_id":"T2xeqjfY8CFvqmz7","name":"Cleric","type":"class","img":"icons/skills/trades/academics-merchant-scribe.webp","data":{"description":"\n\t\t\t\t<p>Clerics are moral and spiritual leaders, warriors of faith who preach the will of the gods, interpret omens and portents, and strike down the evil or unfaithful. Most clerics have a patron deity, but some are champions of a particular moral alignment, venerating all deities of that alignment in addition to a patron deity, and yet others are the servants of a particular pantheon of deities. In a world of swords and sorcery, force of arms often speaks louder than moral suasion, and clerics are trained to do battle against the enemies of their gods. Some clerics are fanatics, zealously seeking new converts or hunting heretics. Others seem almost burdened by an inconvenient or even oppressive relationship with the divine forces. Evil clerics - sinister villains who prey upon fear and jealousy - sow discord in the world and gather converts for their demonic masters.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Clerics play an important support role for an adventuring party. Most clerical spells are oriented toward healing, strengthening, and defending others. However, when the need arises the cleric is fully capable of taking a place in the line of battle and smiting down infidels and foes. Clerics employ their holy symbols rather than spell books as a focus for their meditation. Cleric spells are automatically acquired as the cleric gains levels and no check is necessary to ensure they are understood; thus clerics may normally memorise any spell appropriate to their level. However, in some circumstances the powers the cleric serves may intervene and grant different spells to those requested; it is suggested that this is only done in extreme cases (such as when the cleric has been guilty of an alignment transgression of some kind, for example; more serious transgressions may result in fewer spells being granted, or even none at all). Some GMs may permit clerics of specific deities to have slightly different abilities from those described here.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>When a cleric attains ninth level, he or she has accumulated sufficient divine favour and mortal renown to found a temple/stronghold. Such places are normally carved from the wilderness, in the same manner as a fighter establishes a freehold. For a cleric to assume the leadership of an existing temple, the details are left to the discretion of the GM; a level somewhat higher than ninth might be required. Whether the cleric estab-lishes a stronghold or a temple, followers and acolytes will flock to the cleric's banner.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Minimum Scores: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Str 6, Dex 3, Con 6, Int 6, Wis 9, Cha 6</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Hit Die Type: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>d8 (max 9)</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Alignment: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Any</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Experience bonus: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Wisdom 16+</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Armour/Shield Permitted: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Any</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapons Permitted: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Blunt only - club, flail, hammer, mace, oil, staff; clerics may hurl hammers, clubs, or oil, but may not employ other missile weapons</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapon Proficiencies: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>2 + 1 every 3 levels</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Penalty to hit for non-proficiency: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>-3</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapon Specialisation: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>N/A</p>\n\t\t\t\t<h1>Cleric Class Abilities</h1>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Spell Casting: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Clerics may memorise and cast clerical spells in accordance with the tables provided hereafter.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Turning Undead: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Clerics can \"turn\" the undead, making them flee from the cleric's holiness (or, in the case of an evil cleric, bringing them to heel as servants and minions).

{"_id":"XSw0D8MzgA6QVLzc","name":"Assassin","type":"class","img":"icons/skills/trades/academics-merchant-scribe.webp","data":{"description":"\n\t\t\t\t<p>Assassins are stealthy killers, trained by their shadowy guilds in the arts of spying, disguise, poison, and murder. Although assassins of lower level are little more than welltrained thugs, the eminences of this reprehensible profession are so feared as to be spoken of only in whispers. High-level assassins are artists of murder, and their experience with hunting highly-placed targets, coupled with extensive education and training, often gives the sinister nobility of this class a silken, refined veneer over their true, murderous natures. This veneer, like many things pertaining to the assassins, is deceptive; survival in the higher echelons of an assassins' guild requires animal cunning and a complete absence of mercy. Assassin characters must begin with an evil alignment.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Virtually all cities (and many towns) will have a guild of assassins operating within the city walls and in the surrounding region, made up of 6-24 assassins of varying level. Player character assassins, if they are identified by the local guild, will be invited to join (such invitations ranging from polite to violent). Joining a guild places the assassin under the command of the local guildmaster, which may be inconvenient (and will require the assassin to pay a share of his take to the guild), but assassins' guilds take a very dim view of freelancers working in their territory. Freelance assassins - and their companions - do not ordinarily live to enjoy old age. There are, of course, benefits to joining such a guild; training costs may be reduced, and the guild may be a good source of information about potential missions or nearby enemies.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Assassins' guilds are controlled by a guildmaster of 14th level - an assassin of lower level might take control, but would be unable to inspire the fear necessary to keep rival guilds from forming. To gain 14th level, an assassin character must take control of an assassins' guild by killing (directly or indirectly) the existing guildmaster. Whenever the control of an assassins' guild changes hands, most of the assassins will abandon the guild and depart the area, normally leaving the guild reduced to a quarter of its original membership.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The grandmaster of assassins (a campaign may have one or more) is a figure of legend and fear. These dark eminences usually live far from the cities, in remote and well-guarded locations - their fame is such that those who need their services will seek them out. To advance to 15th level, an assassin must find and kill one of the existing grandmasters.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Minimum Scores: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Str 12, Dex 12, Con 6, Int 11, Wis 6</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Hit Die Type: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>d6 (max 15)</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Alignment: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Any evil</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Experience bonus: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>None</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Armour/Shield Permitted: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Leather or studded leather only (shields allowed)</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapons Permitted: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Any</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapon Proficiencies: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>3 + 1 every 4 levels</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Penalty to hit for non-proficiency: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>-3</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapon Specialisation: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>N/A</p>\n\t\t\t\t<h1>Assassin Class Abilities</h1>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Assassination: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>If an assassin gains surprise (see \"Combat\") he or she may elect to assassinate the victim. The assassin need not roll to hit for an assassination attempt, which is a special attack resulting in a chance to kill the victim instantly and ensure damage even if the victim is not successfully killed. The percentage chance to kill a victim is 50%, with a bonus of 5% per level of the assassin and a penalty of 5% for every two levels of the target (rounding down; in the case of monsters, substitute \"hit dice\" for \"level\"). These numbers are approximate, for the GM should modify the assassin's chances slightly upward or downward according to the circumstances - guarded or wary targets are less likely to be killed, and unwary victims are more likely to die. If the assassination attempt does not succeed, the attack still inflicts normal damage, together with any applicable bonuses. The assassin does not gain backstab multiple damage on a failed assassination attempt, even if the assassination attempt was made from behind.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Backstab: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>An assassin may backstab with any of the melee weapons permissible to the thief class. Backstabbing doubles the weapon's damage at levels 1-4, triple at levels 5-8, quadruple at level 9-12, and so on. Also, an assassin attacks from behind with a bonus to hit of +4 rather than the ordinary +2.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Disguise: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Assassins are masters of disguise. Within reasonable limits, an assassin can make him- or herself appear slightly shorter or considerably taller, fatter or thinner, or of the opposite gender. An assassin can even disguise him- or herself as a member of another race (again, within reason). Any person observing the disguised assassin has a base 2% chance to see through the disguise, with one chance per day to do so. The base chance of seeing through a disguise increases another 2% if the assassin is posing as another class, race or gender (max 8% chance).

To cast the spell, the magic user must know the fiendish creature's name, and inscribe it into a scroll, the preparation of which requires [[/roll 8d6]] hours and the expenditure of at least 5,000 gp. Once the spell is cast, if the scroll is read aloud by the caster in the fiend's presence it will have the effects described below. A caster can create no more than one scroll for any particular fiend and can only keep three such scrolls in existence at any one time; the magic of one will fade if a fourth is created.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>When the caster speaks the first words of the scroll in the fiend's presence, the demon is immediately held in place (unless its innate magic resistance allows it to escape this effect). Even if the fiend's magic resistance protects it, the words of the scroll cause considerable agony, and if the creature has the ability to escape it is only 10% likely to remain and try to stop the final reading (0% likelihood if it has no means of attacking the magic user, gaining possession of the scroll, or otherwise influencing events in its favour). After one full minute of reading the scroll (i.e., in the second round), the fiend loses 1 hp/ hit die from pain.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>In the third round, the fiend loses 50% of its remaining hit points from the agony caused by the words of the scroll. After the third round of reading, the fiend is banished to its home plane, where it writhes in agony for a period of years equal to the caster's level. Obviously, any fiend caught with this ritual will seek to negotiate its way out; the GM will determine probabilities based on the fiend's goals and personality, but the base likelihood will be roughly 25% per round that the fiend will agree to perform a task for the caster in exchange for nothing more than the cessation of the ritual.</p>\n\t\t\t","dmonlytext":"","itemList":[],"attributes":{"rarity":"","type":"","subtype":"","magic":false,"properties":[],"identified":true},"charges":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0},"location":{"state":"carried","parent":""},"resource":{"itemId":""},"actions":[{"img":"icons/weapons/staves/staff-ornate-red.webp","ability":"none","type":"cast","targeting":"","successAction":"none","formula":"","otherdmg":[],"effectList":[],"effect":{"duration":{"formula":"","type":"round"},"changes":[]},"speed":99,"damagetype":"slashing","resource":{"type":"none","itemId":"","reusetime":"","count":{"cost":1,"min":0,"max":1,"value":0}},"magicpotency":0,"properties":[],"dmonlytext":"","itemList":[],"saveCheck":{"type":"none","formula":""},"abilityCheck":{"type":"none","formula":""},"id":"ky6uc3r6j3j06320","index":0,"name":"Spirit-Rack"}],"quantity":0,"weight":0,"cost":{"value":0,"currency":"gp"},"source":"OSRIC","xp":0,"audio":{"effect":"","success":"","failure":""},"type":"Arcane","level":"6","school":"Abjuration","sphere":"MU","range":"10 ft + 1 ft/ level","components":{"verbal":true,"somatic":false,"material":true},"materials":{"value":null,"consumed":false,"cost":0,"count":0},"durationText":"See below","castingTime":"8d6 hours","areaOfEffect":"One fiend","save":"None"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PXJxlGCNBzbPFTjR":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"348d00bcdcc295f5558272c55b0b7094a86b829f","sourceId":"Item.aO5OdENCREZFohdL"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.osric-pc-item.aO5OdENCREZFohdL"},"cf":{"id":"temp_0dyvs3tb97ir","path":"osric-pc-item#/CF_SEP/spell","color":"#000000"}}}

Thus, if a fireball explodes in the middle of a corridor 10 ft wide and 10 ft high, the blast will extend a staggering 165 ft in both directions. It is quite possible, particularly in dungeoneering environments, for the magic user to be caught in the backblast of his or her own fireball spell.

A lengthy apprenticeship of study and practice allows these somewhat eerie individuals to store arcane energy within their minds and to release it in the form of spells. Magic users cast spells by speaking a few magic words, weaving complex gestures in the air, and employing rare and magical materials. While magic users (with illusionists) are the weakest character class in combat, this weakness is balanced by possessing the most powerful and versatile spells in the game.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The full underlying principles of magic are beyond mortal comprehension; even wizards of the profoundest intellect struggle from momentary inklings to understand its more complex patterns. Nevertheless, those character who possess formidable intelligence and a certain intuitive gift, who are willing to devote themselves to a lifetime of study, may in time sufficiently master the art to be capable of shifting mountains and shattering entire armies. High-level magic users are the most feared and dangerous characters in the game.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Magic users do not gain bonus spells for high intelligence scores; intelligence does determine which spells they can understand and how many spells they may learn for each spell level.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Magic users are dependent upon their spell books, and normally may only cast spell they have learned from these books (exception: magic users may cast spells from arcane magical scrolls). Mages may not cast spells from divine, druidic or phantasmal magic scrolls. The acquisition of a new spell is difficult and demanding and must normally be accomplished through adventuring, although the mage will automatically receive one new spell of the highest spell level that he or she may cast upon acquiring a new level of experience.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>OSRIC magic users are superficially similar to the wizards of fantasy literature such as Gandalf and Merlin, but they are more closely similar to mages described in the works of Jack Vance. His \"Dying Earth\" cycle, and particularly \"Rhialto the Marvellous\", are highly recommended.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Magic users are the only class capable of fabricating magic items that they cannot themselves employ. Clerics, druids and illusionists can fabricate magic items, but only those they themselves can use; items such as magical swords, that no primary spell casting class may use, are in their creation the sole province of magic users.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>At 11th level, a magic user may establish a stronghold (usually a tower or small keep) in the same manner as a fighter.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Minimum Scores: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Str 3, Dex 6, Int 9, Wis 6,Con 6, Cha 6</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Hit Die Type: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>d4 (max 11)</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Alignment: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Any</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Experience bonus: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Int 16+</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Armour/Shield Permitted: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>None</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapons Permitted: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Dagger, dart, oil, staff</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapon Proficiencies: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>1 + 1 per 5 levels</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Penalty to hit for non-proficiency: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>-5</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Weapon Specialisation: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>N/A</p>\n\t\t\t\t<h1>Magic User Class Abilities</h1>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>Spellcasting: </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</b>Magic users may memorise and cast arcane spells in accordance with the tables provided below.

By combining expensive material components with the spell, the caster can make it more likely that the gold will seem true - conversely, there are mundane methods that give a chance to detect this very spell, such as striking the \"gold\" with cold iron (10% chance of changing the metal back).

Their magic is rooted in the mystical oneness of nature, and they have particular power over fire, stone, and weather, as well as over plant- and animal life.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Some druids pay homage to particular nature gods (some of these quite savage), while others eschew all deities and commune directly with the spiritual power of nature.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Rather than using a holy symbol as clerics do, druids require mistletoe, holly, or (if neither can be found) oak leaves to cast their spells, and one of these is a required component for all druidic spells unless a druidic spell has no material component specified in the spell description.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>The druid must harvest these materials by the light of a full moon, or the darkness of a new moon, in order for the component to work with full efficacy. If mistletoe or holly is not gathered by the druid's hand at the proper time, the druid's spells will have only half the normal effect. Oak leaves always produce spells of half power, and if they are not harvested properly, oak leaves will permit spells of only one-quarter power.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Player character druids must be neutral, although druids of differing alignments may be found as non-player characters in some GMs' campaigns.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Druids receive bonus spells for high wisdom, just as clerics do.

This more powerful evocation of phantasmal magic allows the caster to weave vague sounds into the illusion and to maintain the illusion even if moving at up to half his or her normal movement rate.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<i>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<u>REFERENCED TEXT </u>\n\t\t\t\t\t</i>: This extremely flexible spell allows the caster to craft a visual illusion of virtually anything that can fit within the spell's area of effect....</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>...There is no saving throw against the illusion if the observer believes it, and the illusion can actually cause damage to such a deceived victim. A demon wielding a sword can attack and do damage, and the appearance of a pit full of spikes can be fatal even though it is not real. If the observer doubts the reality of the illusion, he or she will be permitted a saving throw to see the illusion for what it really is. If one observer disbelieves the illusion and this disbelief is communicated to others, the others will also gain a saving throw at a bonus of +4.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>...Various methods may be used by the GM to determine if an NPC or monster believes the effect of a phantasmal force, common sense being the first thing to consider. A player who takes care to craft a believable illusion should be rewarded for skilful use of the spell, not forced into a table of random results.</p>\n\t\t\t","dmonlytext":"","itemList":[],"attributes":{"rarity":"","type":"","subtype":"","magic":false,"properties":[],"identified":true},"charges":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":0},"location":{"state":"carried","parent":""},"resource":{"itemId":""},"actions":[{"img":"icons/weapons/staves/staff-ornate-red.webp","ability":"none","type":"cast","targeting":"","successAction":"none","formula":"","otherdmg":[],"effectList":[],"effect":{"duration":{"formula":"","type":"round"},"changes":[]},"speed":6,"damagetype":"slashing","resource":{"type":"none","itemId":"","reusetime":"","count":{"cost":1,"min":0,"max":1,"value":0}},"magicpotency":0,"properties":[],"dmonlytext":"","itemList":[],"saveCheck":{"type":"none","formula":""},"abilityCheck":{"type":"none","formula":""},"id":"hll9uuprefi8lwnk","index":0,"name":"Permanent Illusion"},{"img":"icons/weapons/staves/staff-ornate-red.webp","ability":"none","type":"cast","targeting":"","successAction":"none","formula":"","otherdmg":[],"effectList":[],"effect":{"duration":{"formula":"","type":"round"},"changes":[]},"speed":6,"damagetype":"slashing","resource":{"type":"none","itemId":"","reusetime":"","count":{"cost":1,"min":0,"max":1,"value":0}},"magicpotency":0,"properties":[],"dmonlytext":"","itemList":[],"saveCheck":{"type":"spell","formula":""},"abilityCheck":{"type":"none","formula":""},"id":"i9b5rd2a5jo73ep1","index":1,"name":"Permanent Illusion"}],"quantity":0,"weight":0,"cost":{"value":0,"currency":"gp"},"source":"OSRIC","xp":0,"audio":{"effect":"","success":"","failure":""},"type":"Arcane","level":"6","school":"Illusion","sphere":"Phantasmal","range":"30 ft","components":{"verbal":true,"somatic":true,"material":true},"materials":{"value":null,"consumed":false,"cost":0,"count":0},"durationText":"Permanent","castingTime":"6 segments","areaOfEffect":"40 ft x 40 ft square + 10 ft x 10 ft square/ level","save":"See below"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PXJxlGCNBzbPFTjR":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"hash":"835970661176c5b77496abecb7f152ec8f8181ae","sourceId":"Item.zdZDt6owvLZIJxYs"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.osric-pc-item.zdZDt6owvLZIJxYs"},"cf":{"id":"temp_0dyvs3tb97ir","path":"osric-pc-item#/CF_SEP/spell","color":"#000000"}}}
